# Optical-character-recognitiion
created an app for ocr.

IMPLEMENTATION:
●I connected my mobile camera and python terminal using ip camera for scanning the page easily using mobile camera but processing the image in python.
● I used videocapture to fix my frame and then Saved that frame for further image processing work.By this i got the image of my scanned handwritten or printed text.
● Using ip,contours are extracted and appended in array and the array is fed into a for loop for prediction.
● My model is based on tensorflow and keras framework.
● I used cnn sequential model to achieve this.
● Predicted text in written in a samplefile in my laptop
